Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array].
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
 

Follow up: Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.

steps:
1. i constructd a map to store them in pair (number, count);
2. after that i constructd another map that container mapping through the (count, vector<int>>) so in the vector i was storing the element that have occured count times.
3. after that i ran loop from end on the second map
4. then by using the varibale to count the no. of element that return in the answer i return them into the another vector.

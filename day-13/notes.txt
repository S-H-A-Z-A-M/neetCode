42. Trapping Rain Water

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

 

Example 1:


Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
Example 2:

Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
 

Constraints:

n == height.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
0 <= height[i] <= 105

solution step:

1. First we create four variable l ,r and lmax ,rmax.
2. then we ran a while loop until l and r dont cross over.
3. then we checked which of the lmax and rmax is smaller.
4. for eg. if lmax<rmax, then lmax will be checked with current l and if the answer
    is greater than one it will added to the result and if not it will be changed for the
    current lmax.
5. after the for loop end we return the result

84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram

Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

 

Example 1:


Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.
Example 2:


Input: heights = [2,4]
Output: 4
 

Constraints:

1 <= heights.length <= 105
0 <= heights[i] <= 104


solution step:

1. first we create a stack of pair.
2. in pair we store <index, height>
3. the logic is we push the element until smaller element doesnt appear.
4. now if the element is smaller we we calculate the area using the formaula
(height of the element * (current index - stored index)) till there are no smaller element
in the stack by poping them and then we store the current element with the index of the last popped element.
5. after that calculation we store the max area in the area
6. now some element may not get pop since no smaller element that they may arrive.
7. at that time we just calculate their area from their height * (size of height - stored index) .

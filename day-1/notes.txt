Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
 

Follow up: What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?



solution:

    Steps 1: First i created an vector with length equal to number of alphabetic characters
    steps 2: Then by using the hashing method i made the characters of string match the alphabetic characters by subracting 97(starting value of lower alphabet)
    steps 3: After that i inserted them at the respected value in the vector
    steps 4: Then i direclty return the value of the vector by comparing them with each other

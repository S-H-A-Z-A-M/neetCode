Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

 

Example 1:

Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
Example 2:

Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]
Example 3:

Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]
 

Constraints:

1 <= temperatures.length <= 105
30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100

solution step:

1. first we created an stack of pair.
2. then we pushed first pair<value,index>.
3. now we ran the loop till the size of the array.
4. now if the element is less than the current element we just push them.
5. but if the element is greater push the (current index - stored index) at stored index value.
6. after the loop is ended we return result vector.
